## 1.1 ##
GC content metrics showed irregularities at the beginning of the sequences
That may comes from some adaptor sequence at the beginning of the sequences.
Also, this is a common issue due to the sequencing technology limitations. The beginning sequence always have low quality and cause the signal to be irregular and unstable.
## 1.2 ##
- most overrepresented sequence: Drosophila melanogaster strain Canton S serine protease 3, serine protease 1 (SER1), and serine protease 2 (SER2) genes.
- Rationale: Serine proteases are enzymes that play crucial roles in digestion, immune response, and tissue remodeling in Drosophila. In the Drosophila midgut, these enzymes might be highly expressed because of its role in digestion.

- Yes, there are clearly Defined Blocks of Triplicates. It suggests that the replicates have high consistency between replicates.
## 3.3 ##
The labels for LFC-Fe Rep3 and Fe Rep1 have been swapped.
## 3.6 ##
Yes.
the biological processes inclued glutamine biosynthetic process, ethanol metabolic process, negative regulation of oskar mRNA translation, and positive regulation of cell proliferation involved in compound eye morphogenesis. The result aligns with the fact that Drosophila midgut is evolved in multiple metablolic processes.
