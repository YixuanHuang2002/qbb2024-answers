### Step 3.1 What do each of these values mean, based on the descriptions of what is being labeled?
- Mean Nascent RNA Signal: The average fluorescence intensity of the nascent RNA channel for all pixels corresponding to a labeled nucleus. The level of RNA synthesis occurring in each nucleus, as nascent RNA represents newly transcribed RNA. Higher values indicate higher transcriptional activity.
- Mean PCNA Signal: The average fluorescence intensity of the PCNA channel for all pixels corresponding to a labeled nucleus. The level of DNA replication activity in each nucleus. PCNA is a marker of replication activity, with higher values indicating more active DNA replication.
- Log2 Ratio (Nascent RNA / PCNA): The base-2 logarithmic ratio of the mean nascent RNA signal to the mean PCNA signal for each nucleus. A relative measure of transcriptional activity compared to replication activity within a nucleus. A higher ratio suggests that transcription is dominant over replication, whereas a lower ratio suggests the opposite.
### Step 3.2 Look at the knocked-down gene with the highest ratio and the one with the lowest ratio. Look up what their functions are and explain if you think this result makes sense.
- highest ratio: SRSF1. Knockdown of SRSF1 may impair efficient splicing and processing of nascent RNA, potentially leading to an accumulation of partially processed or unspliced RNA. This could result in an artificially high measurement of nascent RNA relative to DNA replication activity, as measured by PCNA.
- lowest ratio: POLR2B. POLR2B is a critical subunit of RNA Polymerase II, which is essential for RNA transcription. When POLR2B is knocked down, the RNA transcription machinery is severely compromised, resulting in a dramatic decrease in nascent RNA production.
