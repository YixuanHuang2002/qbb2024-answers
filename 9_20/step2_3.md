1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell?
- Exons.
- their expression values decrease the most as Minor Allele frequency increases.This suggests that exons are under higher level of negative seletion.


2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases? 
- Lower MAFs may indicate that the mutation has not undergo seletion yet. As MAF increases, the new MAFs will be purged from the population under seletion if they are not in favor of human's survival. So the enchrichment tends to decrease in higher MAFs. 
- Another possible explanation is that low MAFs may not cause servere outcome, thus not be purged from the population quickly under selection. But higher MAFs often brings higher risks of interfering the normal function of the gene, thus has a larger chance to be depleted.

3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.
Yes. Exons are typically most vunerable to mutations because changes in protein sequence have direct effect on the protein function. This will make exons be under the strongest purifying selection. Rugulatory elements is responsible for regulating the expression level of protein, thus will be moderately influenced by mutations, but will not cause conplete loss of protein function. Most MAFs in intron will not cause notable difference in protein function and expression level because they will be spliced anyway. But some mutations in splicing site will lead to missplicing and also lead to loss of protein fucntion. Other region show the least seletion pressure because they are not related to protein function and has little impact on the survival of human.
Regions more related to protein fuction and expression level will be influenced most, vice versa.
